What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Execute git init on the directory - this places .git file in the directory
You need to add files to repository and commit.
git status shows the status and a list of files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
working directory - all files in dir stored on hard disk - could be untracked
staging - files added to git to be tracked

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Add files in logical groups & commit
