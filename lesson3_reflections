When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To allow you to work from multiple computers and locations and to easily collaborate with lots of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To ensure you pull changes when it is appropriate for you and your work isnt overwritten unexpectedly.

Notes:
Set up SSH keys and two factor authentication.
Using SSH instead of HTTPS.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch - branch of your existing repository for experimental purposes/collaboration - intended to merge with master
Fork - A clone of someone else's repository which gives credit to the original aauthor and allows you to modify in your own repository - a GitHub feature
Clone - a copy of another repository with no link to give any credit
