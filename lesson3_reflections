When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To allow you to work from multiple computers and locations and to easily collaborate with lots of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To ensure you pull changes when it is appropriate for you and your work isnt overwritten unexpectedly.
